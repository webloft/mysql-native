# Run Tests Locally:
# ------------------
#
# ./run_tests --mode=(phobos|vibe|combined) [--help] [OPTIONS] [-- [UNIT-THREADED OPTIONS]]
#
# After first run (which will fail), you will need to edit the
# generated `testConnectionStr.txt` to match the correct connection
# and login settings for your DB server.
#
# Testing and Official Compatibility:
# -----------------------------------
#
# All testing configurations not marked as "allow_failures" in the master
# branch are considered officially supported. If any of these configurations
# fail in travis, then the commit/branch is considered broken.
#
# Test configurations marked "allow_failures" are NOT officially supported.
# Typically, this will be due to one of the following reasons:
#
# - There is a known bug using that configuration which has not yet
# been fixed. There should be ticket(s) filed in GitHub for these.
#
# - The test is automatically monitoring compatibility with new versions of
# dependencies as they are released. These tests are expected to periodically
# fail as mysql-native encounters new dependency versions it has not yet
# previously encountered. These are deliberately "allow_failures" BECAUSE
# they are previously untested and therefore we cannot guarantee compatibility.
#
# Once travis greenlights a new configuration, a NEW entry should be added for
# it which does NOT use "latest available" markers such as `dmd`, `dmd-beta` or
# `DUB_UPGRADE=true`.
#
# Test Failures and Deprecations:
# -------------------------------
#
# To the extent possible, care should be taken to ensure the master branch
# is always greenlit in travis. This means:
#
# - Work-in progress should be done in a separate branch.
#
# - Only branches greenlit in travis should be merged to master.
#
# - In the event a broken configuration cannot be immediately fixed, it
# should be filed in GitHub as a known issue, temporarily removed from official
# support, and marked as "allow_failures" so as to not block additional
# work in the meantime.
#
# Official compatibility for any dependency (including compiler and
# database server) should ONLY be dropped when it has become broken and
# is no longer trivial to fix. (Though exceptions may be granted in special
# circumstances, given strong enough reason to support/deprecate a
# particular dependency version.)
#
# Selecting Configurations to Test:
# ---------------------------------
#
# It would be impractical (and likely an abuse of travis's free infrastructure)
# to test every possible combination of OS, compiler, DB server and
# dub dependency (ie, vibe-d and its dependencies.) So we have to be strategic
# about selecting configurations to test. Here are guidelines:
#
# - For DMD, only the latest patch release for each major.minor version needs
# tested. (Example: DMD v2.081.x goes up to v2.081.2. Therefore, v2.081.2
# should be tested, but v2.081.0 and v2.081.1 can be omitted.) This is
# reasonable because patch releases to DMD are expected to be highly
# backwards-compatible with regression fixes only.
#
# - Each compiler version should be tested at least once. And at least
# one of these tests for each compiler version should be against the oldest
# version of vibe-d which can be supported for the given compiler. (Otherwise,
# it would not be possible to reliably ensure ANY particular minimum version of
# vibe-d.)
#
# - There should be at least one test for the oldest supported vibe-d and
# at least one for the newest supported vibe-d. Additional tests for more
# versions in-between would be better.
#
# - To the extent possible, each DB server version should be tested at least
# once. And at least one of these tests for each DB server version should be
# on a compiler and vibe-d that are NOT generically "use whatever is the
# latest version available". This helps avoid any question as to whether
# a failure is due to the specific DB server or due to breakage on a new
# compiler/vibe.
#
# - When possible, there should be at least one test that IS generically
# for "use whatever is the latest version available of XYZ" (for any XYZ).
# But, these tests must be marked "allow_failures" to ensure reproducable
# builds (at least to the extent possible) and to ensure new versions of
# dependencies get properly tested before being allowed to break the build
# or to become officially supported.
#
# - These guidelines are largely relaxed on OSX because:
#     - Travis's OSX infrastructure is smaller and so OSX builds
#     are considerably slower.
#     - Quick obsolescence is deeply ingrained on the OSX ecosystem anyway.
#     - I know little about doing OSX builds, so better support would
#     need to come from a volunteer more experienced in OSX.
#
# Vibe-d and Other Dub Dependencies:
# ----------------------------------
#
# The repository should always include a `dub.selections.json`. This should
# have no effect on projects depending on mysql-native, but it will help
# ensure developers don't run into problems unexpectedly building against
# new dependency versions that haven't yet been fully tested and verified
# against mysql-native. Developers can always do a "dub upgrade" on their
# own working copy or work if they so choose. Just remember not to check
# in the changes to `dub.selections.json`.
#
# For travis-ci testing, all jobs are required to select a specific set of
# dependency versions via one of the `dub.selections.WHATEVER.json` files.
# This is done by setting the `DUB_SELECT=WHATEVER` environment variable.
# The chosen selection will then be used as `dub.selections.json`.
#
# Alternatively, one of the environment variable `DUB_UPGRADE=true` or
# `NO_VIBE=true` can be used instead of `DUB_SELECT=...`:
#
# Using `DUB_UPGRADE=true` causes `dub upgrade` to be run in order to test
# on the latest available versions of all dub dependencies. But please only
# do this on `allowed_failures` tests, to help ensure reproducable builds.
#
# Using `NO_VIBE=true` can be used to test ONLY with
# Phobos threads and skip testing with vibe entirely (useful on platforms
# and older compilers which don't work with the `vibe-core` package.)
#
# Independent of the other settings, using `USE_UNIT_THREADED=true` causes
# the tests to be run via unit-threaded instead of the Phobos test runner.
