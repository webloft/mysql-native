v2.2.0 - 2018-03-03
=====================

Maintenance release.

- **Fixed:** [#165](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/165):
	MySQLPool should automatically reopen any closed connections.
	(Not as big of a deal as it sounds because closed connections
	automatically reconnect upon use anyway. This just makes it eager
	instead of lazy and ensures there's no confusion from the pool handing
	out a "closed" connection.) (@Abscissa)
- **Fixed:** [#167](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/167):
	ResultRange doesn't get invalidated upon reconnect. (@Abscissa)
- **Fixed:** Remove unnecessary precondition that connection must be
	closed before calling `Connection.connect`. (@Abscissa)
- **Fixed:** [#121](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/121):
	Use `const(char[])` instead of `string` for queries. (@Abscissa)
- **Fixed:** [#13](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/13):
	No support for type modifiers in prepared statement parameters. (@Abscissa)
- **Tests:** Add tests for reconnecting. (@Abscissa)
- **Internal:** [#144](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/144):
	Move all packet handling, etc., into mysql.protocol.comms (@Abscissa)

v2.1.0 - 2018-03-02
=====================

New prepared statement features.

Since v2.1.0-rc2:
- **Fixed:** [#28](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/28):
	MYXProtocol thrown when using large integers as prepared parameters. (@Abscissa)

Since v2.1.0-rc1:
- **Docs:** Update readme example for new simplified prepared statement interface. (@Abscissa)

Since v2.0.0:
- **New:** [#118](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/118):
	Convenience
	[exec/query overloads](http://semitwist.com/mysql-native/mysql/commands.html)
	that do parameterized SQL. (@Abscissa)
- **New:** [#162](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/162):
	Create
	[Connection.releaseAll](http://semitwist.com/mysql-native/mysql/connection/Connection.releaseAll.html)
	(@Abscissa)
- **New:**
	Add a
	[Connection.register](http://semitwist.com/mysql-native/mysql/connection/Connection.register.html)
	overload that takes an sql string, for symmetry with
	[Connection.release](http://semitwist.com/mysql-native/mysql/connection/Connection.release.html)
	(@Abscissa)
- **New:** [#160](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/160):
	Pool-level prepared statement management tools for
	[MySQLPool](http://semitwist.com/mysql-native/mysql/pool/MySQLPool.html),
	including `autoRegister`/`autoRelease`/etc...
	(@Abscissa)
- **Tests:** [#149](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/149):
	Optionally support [unit-threaded](https://github.com/atilaneves/unit-threaded)
	for vibe tests (not used by default) (@Abscissa)
- **Tests:** [#161](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/161):
	Added tests for ParameterSpecialization (ie, chunked transfer). (@Abscissa)

v2.0.0 - 2018-02-13
=====================

Connection-independent redesign of Prepared, plus other new features and housekeeping.
See the [migration guide](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/blob/master/MIGRATING_TO_V2.md).

Since v2.0.0-rc2:
- **Fixed:** ParameterSpecialization chunked transfer fails unless
	the total size is a multiple of the chunk size. (@Abscissa)
- **Docs:** Improve documentation relating to chunked transfer. (@Abscissa)

Since v2.0.0-rc1:
- **Change:** The query functions which take prepared statements no longer
	support `ColumnSpecialization`. Use `Prepared.columnSpecials` instead. (@Abscissa)
- **New:** Added `Prepared.columnSpecials` to get/set the array of `ColumnSpecialization`. (@Abscissa)
- **Docs:** More CSS improvements. (@Abscissa)

Since v1.2.2:
- **Change:** [#95](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/95),
	[#97](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/97),
	[#157](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/157):
	Redesigned Prepared to be connection-independent, support auto-registration
	and fix a few problems. For details, see
	[ABOUT_PREPARED_V2.md](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/blob/master/ABOUT_PREPARED_V2.md)
	(@Abscissa)
- **Change:** `prepare`, `prepareFunction` and `prepareProcedure` have moved
	from `mysql.prepared` to `mysql.connection`. This is because they are
	specific to `Connection`, and the new `Prepared` design (and thus
	`mysql.prepared`) is completely non-dependent on `Connection`.
- **New:** [#115](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/115):
	Added Prepared.lastInsertID to retrieve last ID inserted by the given
	prepared statement. (@Abscissa)
- **New:** [#147](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/147):
	Pools can take optional callback for when new connections are created (@Abscissa)
- **Removed:** Re-removed all deprecated symbols that were removed in v1.2.0 (@Abscissa)
- **Removed:** Removed additional deprecated symbols: (@Abscissa)
	- MySQL[whatever]Exception: Use `MYX[whatever]` instead.
	- querySet/ResultSet: Import std.array and use `query(...).array` to
		receive `Row[]` instead of a ResultSet.
	- MYXDataPending: No longer thrown by mysql-native, as of v1.1.4. You can
		safely remove all MYXDataPending handling from your code.
- **Removed:** Removed long-outdated Vibe.d `EventedObject` interface from `Connection`.
	That is: `acquire()`, `release()`, `isOwner()` and `amOwner()` (@Abscissa)
- **Removed:** [#96](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/96):
	Removed public access to `Connection.getNextRow`, which was
	intended as internal, and has been documented as such for awhile now. (@Abscissa)
- **Deprecated:** `MYXNotPrepared`: The new prepared statement design
	eliminates the need for this exception which is no longer thrown. (@Abscissa)
- **Docs:** [#146](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/146):
	Make sure all ddox cross-linking is fixed. (@Abscissa)
- **Docs:** [#158](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/158):
	Fixed images missing in sidebar, and updated DDOX styles/scripts (@Abscissa)
- **Internal:**
	Renamed debug symbol `MYSQL_INTEGRATION_TESTS` to the more accurate
	`MYSQLN_TESTS`. (@Abscissa)

v1.2.2 - 2018-01-27
=====================

Bugfix

- **Fixed:** [#154](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/154),
	[#155](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/155):
	Connection becomes unusable when mysql server closes socket. (@schveiguy)

v1.2.1 - 2018-01-13
=====================

Fix semver mistake by re-adding deleted symbols.

- **Fixed:** [Semver](https://semver.org/) Requires ALL breaking changes to bump
  the MAJOR version number, never just the MINOR. Fixed this by re-adding the
  old deprecated symbols which were deleted in the previous release. They will
  be removed again in the next release, v2.0.0.

v1.2.0 - 2017-12-15
=====================

Housekeeping: Deprecations, cleanup and doc improvements.

- **Fixed:** Glaring mistakes in the example from `README` and `example.d`. (@Abscissa)
- **Fixed:** [#133](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/133):
	Sometimes null is incorrectly indicated by Variant containing `void` rather
	than `null` as intended. (@Marenz)
- **Fixed:** [#152](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/152):
	Exception when sending Timestamp in prepared statement. (@Abscissa)
- **Removed:** Removed deprecated symbols: (@Abscissa)
	- queryResult: Use querySet instead.
	- querySequence: Use query instead.
	- queryTuple: Use queryRowTuple instead.
	- struct Command: This is obsolete pre-v1.0.0 interface. Use the functions
		in mysql.commands and mysql.prepared instead.
	- mysql.db: Use mysql.pool instead.
	- MysqlDB: Use  mysql.pool.MySQLPool instead.
	- struct DBValue: Use std.variant.Variant instead.
	- ResultSequence: Use ResultRange instead.
- **Deprecated:** Newly deprecated symbols: (@Abscissa)
	- [#145](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/145):
		MySQL[whatever]Exception: Use `MYX[whatever]` instead.
	- [#126](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/126):
		querySet/ResultSet: Import std.array and use `query(...).array` to
		receive `Row[]` instead of a ResultSet.
	- MYXDataPending: No longer thrown by mysql-native, as of v1.1.4. You can
		safely remove all MYXDataPending handling from your code.
- **Docs:** API documentation now displays the lib version and permalinks to
	the homepages of the project, the current API docs, the latest API docs
	and the list of api docs for previous versions. (@Abscissa)
- **Docs:** Various documentation updates. (@Abscissa)
- **Docs:** [#128](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/128):
	Show connection string format in readme example. (@Abscissa)
- **Docs:** [#136](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/136):
	Document D <-> MySQL type mappings. (@Abscissa)
- **Tests:** Include `example.d` in tests. (@Abscissa)
- **Tests:** Fixed deprecation messages when compiling tests. (@Abscissa)
- **Tests:** [#140](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/140):
	Add a travis job to test after a `dub upgrade`. (@SingingBush)

v1.1.4 - 2017-12-04
=====================

Introduced auto-purge to fix a few problems.

- **Fixed:**
	[#117](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/117):
	ResultRange cannot be copied. (@Abscissa)
- **Fixed:**
	[#119](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/119):
	Is a defensive `Connection.purgeResult` call necessary before executing another statement?
	(As of this release, the answer changed from "sometimes" to "no") (@Abscissa)
- **Fixed:**
	[#139](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/139):
	Server packet out of order when Prepared is destroyed too early. (@Abscissa)
- **Change:**
	MySQLDataPendingException (aka, MYXDataPending) is no longer necessary,
	and no longer thrown. When issuing a command that communicates with the
	server while a ResultRange still has data pending, instead of throwing,
	mysql-native now automatically purges the range and safely marks it as
	invalid and no longer usable. This was changed in order to fix #117, #119,
	and #139. This change should neither break user code nor require
	any changes. (@Abscissa)
- **Change:**
	Manually releasing a prepared statement is no longer guaranteed to notify
	the server immediately. In order to facilitate the above fixes, and avoid
	any nasty surprise with struct dtors triggering results purges implicitly,
	any release of prepared statements from the server is now queued until
	mysql-native can be certain no data is already pending. This change should
	neither break user code nor require any changes. (@Abscissa)
- **Change:**
	Prepared statements are no longer released automatically, due to the fix
	for #117. However, prepared statements and their lifetimes are tied to
	individual connections, and thus will die along with their connection,
	so manual release is not strictly necessary either. Accordingly, this
	change should neither break user code nor require any changes. (@Abscissa)
- **Fixed:**
	[#143](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/143):
	Keep travis-ci build times under control by limiting the number of
	compiler versions tested on OSX. (@SingingBush)

v1.1.3 - 2017-12-02
=====================

- **Fixed:**
	[#138](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/138):
	Prepared: Prevent mem allocs during cleanup. (@Marenz)
- **Fixed:**
	[#135](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/135):
	Now works on DMD 2.076 and up. (@SingingBush)
- **New:**
	[#135](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/135):
	Add travis-ci testing for OSX. (@SingingBush)
- **Fixed:**
	DMD 2.074.x gives compile error when building tests. (@Abscissa)

v1.1.2 - 2017-09-20
=====================

- **Fixed:**
	[#130](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/130):
	Compilation error when compiling in singleFile mode. (@Marenz)

v1.1.1 - 2017-09-20
=====================

- **Fixed:**
	[#116](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/116):
	Prevent segfault on copying ResultRange. (@schveiguy)
- **Fixed:**
	[#120](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/120):
	Fix typos / grammars in documentation (@Marenz)
- **Fixed:**
	[#124](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/124):
	Fix deprecations: Change deprecated std.string.munch to std.algorithm.skipOver. (@Kozzi11)

v1.1.0 - 2017-06-08
=====================

- **Fixed:**
	[#99](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/99):
	Update dub.sdl to allow vibe-d 0.8.* releases.
- **Fixed:**
	[#111](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/111):
	NEWDECIMAL type returns the wrong value. Since this type is intended as arbitrary
	precision, the server itself sends it as a string. In order to avoid unexpected
	loss of precision, mysql-native does not attempt to convert the string to a
	floating-point type. If conversion to floating point is required, users can simply
	pass the string to Phobos's `to!real` themselves.

v1.0.0 - 2017-02-26
=====================
- **Summary:**
	API overhauled for better safety, reliability and ease-of-use. Deprecated and
	replaced entire Command struct with better design. Better handling of null.
	Improved/expanded docs. Various bugs fixed. More rigorous test suite.
- **New:**
	[#85](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/85):
	Redesigned SQL-based functions. Use the various `query` functions for
	SELECT-like commands (to receive a result set), or the `exec` function for
	non-SELECT commands to receive "rows affected".
- **New:**
	New modules for better organization of features:
	- **New:**
		Module `mysql.prepared`: Home of the newly redesigned prepared statement
		functionality.
	- **Change:**
		Module `mysql.exceptions`: Contains all exceptions defined by mysql-native.
	- **Change:**
		Module `mysql.metadata`: Metadata-related symbols formerly from
		`mysql.protocol.extra_types`.
	- **Change:**
		Module `mysql.types`: Structures for MySQL types not built-in to D/Phobos,
		formerly from `mysql.protocol.extra_types`.
- **New:**
	Prepared statement improvements, including much improved support for null.
	- **New:**
		`Prepared` struct to represent a prepared statement.
	- **New:**
		Prepared statements support setting arguments directly to `null` or `Nullable!T`.
		Using `setNullArg` (formerly `setNullParam`) is no longer necessary (but still supported).
	- **Change:**
		`Row.opIndex` no longer throws if the value is null. Instead, it returns `Variant(null)`.
	- **Change:**
		[#89](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/89):
		Values bound to prepared statement parameters are now taken by value, not by
		reference (but only when using the new `Prepared` struct, not the
		now-deprecated `Command` struct).
	- **Fixed:**
		[#76](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/76):
		Prepared statements are auto-released when their reference count reaches zero.
- **New:**
	Various new subclasses of `MySQLException` added, for better fine-grained control.
- **New:**
	`Row` struct now supports `length` property and `opDollar`.
- **New:**
	[#74](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/74):
	`mysql.pool.MySQLPool` (formerly `mysql.db.MysqlDB`) now supports vibe.d's
	`ConnectionPool.maxConcurrency` feature.
- **Change:**
	Drop support for DMDFE 2.067.x and below. Compiles on
	DMDFE 2.068.2 through 2.072.1. See [.travis.yml](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/blob/master/.travis.yml)
	for full list of supported compilers.
- **Change:**
	[#86](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/86),
	[#87](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/87):
	`Command` struct is now deprecated. Its functionality
	has been split and moved (as appropriate) into Connection, various
	free-functions, and a new reference-counted `Prepared` struct exclusively
	for prepared statements.
- **Change:**
	Renamed `mysql.db.MysqlDB` (misleading. confusing name) to `mysql.pool.MySQLPool`.
- **Change:**
	Module `mysql.connection` no longer acts as a package.d, publicly importing
	other modules. To import all of mysql-native, use `import mysql;`.
- **Change:**
	`ResultSet.asAA` and `ResultRange.asAA` now return Variant[string] instead
	of DBValue[string]. DBValue is no longer needed and now deprecated (as it
	was only used by `asAA` and Variant now handles null properly.)
- **Change:**
	Improved separation between internal (`mysql.protocol`) and external interfaces.
	- **Change:**
		No longer publicly imports internal-only symbols by default.
	- **Change:**
		Renamed module `mysql.protocol.commands` to `mysql.commands`.
	- **Change:**
		Moved `ParameterSpecialization` into `mysql.prepared` (was in `mysql.protocol.extra_types`).
	- **Change:**
		Moved `ColumnSpecialization` into `mysql.commands` (was in `mysql.protocol.extra_types`).
	- **Change:**
		Moved the other public-API members of `mysql.protocol.extra_types` into
		new modules `mysql.metadata` and `mysql.types`.
	- **Change:**
		Removed module `mysql.common`: Its contents have been moved into
		`mysql.exceptions` and `mysql.protocol.sockets`.
- **Fixed:**
	[#75](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/75),
	[#89](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/89):
	Fixed problems where various structs and user data was unsafe to move/copy
	due to usage of internal pointers/references. Such usages of internal
	pointers/references have been eliminated.
- **Fixed:**
	Better safety against new commands being issued before an earlier command is complete.
- **Fixed:**
	Reliability: Now get an MySQLInvalidatedRangeException instead of undefined
	behavior when using a ResultSequence after it's been invalidated by either
	a new command being issued or the results being purged.
- **Fixed:** Many documentation improvements and fixes.
- **Fixed:** More unittests.

v0.1.7 - 2016-10-20

- **New:**
	Test suite automatically tests with both Vibe and Phobos sockets,
	not just Phobos. (@Abscissa)

	DMDFE 2.067.1 through 2.072.0. See [.travis.yml](https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/blob/master/.travis.yml)
	for full list of supported compilers.
