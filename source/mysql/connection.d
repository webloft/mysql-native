Submit an SQL command to the server to be compiled into a prepared statement.

This will automatically register the prepared statement on the provided connection.
The resulting `mysql.prepared.Prepared` can then be used freely on ANY `Connection`,
as it will automatically be registered upon its first use on other connections.
Or, pass it to `Connection.register` if you prefer eager registration.

Internally, the result of a successful outcome will be a statement handle - an ID -
for the prepared statement, a count of the parameters required for
execution of the statement, and a count of the columns that will be present
in any result set that the command generates.

The server will then proceed to send prepared statement headers,
including parameter descriptions, and result set field descriptions,
followed by an EOF packet.

Throws: `mysql.exceptions.MYX` if the server has a problem.

This is a wrapper over `mysql.prepared.Prepared`, provided ONLY as a
temporary aid in upgrading to mysql-native v2.0.0 and its
new connection-independent model of prepared statements. See the
$(LINK2 https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/blob/master/MIGRATING_TO_V2.md, migration guide)
for more info.

In most cases, this layer shouldn't even be needed. But if you have many
lines of code making calls to exec/query the same prepared statement,
then this may be helpful.

To use this temporary compatability layer, change instances of:

---
auto stmt = conn.prepare(...);
---

to this:

---
auto stmt = conn.prepareBackwardCompat(...);
---

And then your prepared statement should work as before.

BUT DO NOT LEAVE IT LIKE THIS! Ultimately, you should update
your prepared statement code to the mysql-native v2.0.0 API, by changing
instances of:

---
stmt.exec()
stmt.query()
stmt.queryRow()
stmt.queryRowTuple(outputArgs...)
stmt.queryValue()
---

to this:

---
conn.exec(stmt)
conn.query(stmt)
conn.queryRow(stmt)
conn.queryRowTuple(stmt, outputArgs...)
conn.queryValue(stmt)
---

Both of the above syntaxes can be used with a `BackwardCompatPrepared`
(the `Connection` passed directly to `mysql.commands.exec`/`mysql.commands.query`
will override the one embedded associated with your `BackwardCompatPrepared`).

Once all of your code is updated, you can change `prepareBackwardCompat`
back to `prepare` again, and your upgrade will be complete.

A class representing a database connection.

If you are using Vibe.d, consider using `mysql.pool.MySQLPool` instead of
creating a new Connection directly. That will provide certain benefits,
such as reusing old connections and automatic cleanup (no need to close
the connection when done).

------------------
// Suggested usage:

{
	auto con = new Connection("host=localhost;port=3306;user=joe;pwd=pass123;db=myappsdb");
	scope(exit) con.close();

	// Use the connection
	...
}
------------------
+/
//TODO: All low-level commms should be moved into the mysql.protocol package.
class Connection
{
/+
The Connection is responsible for handshaking with the server to establish
authentication. It then passes client preferences to the server, and
subsequently is the channel for all command packets that are sent, and all
response packets received.

Uncompressed packets consist of a 4 byte header - 3 bytes of length, and one
byte as a packet number. Connection deals with the headers and ensures that
packet numbers are sequential.

The initial packet is sent by the server - essentially a 'hello' packet
inviting login. That packet has a sequence number of zero. That sequence
number is the incremented by client and server packets through the handshake
sequence.

After login all further sequences are initialized by the client sending a
command packet with a zero sequence number, to which the server replies with
zero or more packets with sequential sequence numbers.

	Flush any outstanding result set elements.

	When the server responds to a command that produces a result set, it
	queues the whole set of corresponding packets over the current connection.
	Before that `Connection` can embark on any new command, it must receive
	all of those packets and junk them.

	As of v1.1.4, this is done automatically as needed. But you can still
	call this manually to force a purge to occur when you want.

	/++
	Manually release a prepared statement on this connection.

	This method tells the server that it can dispose of the information it
	holds about the current prepared statement.

	Calling this is not strictly necessary. The server considers prepared
	statements to be per-connection, so they'll go away when the connection
	closes anyway. This is provided in case direct control is actually needed.

	If you choose to use a reference counted struct to call this automatically,
	be aware that embedding reference counted structs inside garbage collectible
	heap objects is dangerous and should be avoided, as it can lead to various
	hidden problems, from crashes to race conditions. (See the discussion at issue
	$(LINK2 https://github.com/mysql-d/mysql-native/issues/159, #159)
	for details.) Instead, it may be better to simply avoid trying to manage
	their release at all, as it's not usually necessary. Or to periodically
	release all prepared statements, and simply allow mysql-native to
	automatically re-register them upon their next use.

	Notes:

	In actuality, the server might not immediately be told to release the
	statement (although `isRegistered` will still report `false`).

	This is because there could be a `mysql.result.ResultRange` with results
	still pending for retrieval, and the protocol doesn't allow sending commands
	(such as "release a prepared statement") to the server while data is pending.
	Therefore, this function may instead queue the statement to be released
	when it is safe to do so: Either the next time a result set is purged or
	the next time a command (such as `mysql.commands.query` or
	`mysql.commands.exec`) is performed (because such commands automatically
	purge any pending results).

	This function does NOT auto-purge because, if this is ever called from
	automatic resource management cleanup (refcounting, RAII, etc), that
	would create ugly situations where hidden, implicit behavior triggers
	an unexpected auto-purge.

	/++
	Manually release all prepared statements on this connection.

	While minimal, every prepared statement registered on a connection does
	use up a small amount of resources in both mysql-native and on the server.
	Additionally, servers can be configured
	$(LINK2 https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_max_prepared_stmt_count,
	to limit the number of prepared statements)
	allowed on a connection at one time (the default, however
	is quite high). Note also, that certain overloads of `mysql.commands.exec`,
	`mysql.commands.query`, etc. register prepared statements behind-the-scenes
	which are cached for quick re-use later.

	Therefore, it may occasionally be useful to clear out all prepared
	statements on a connection, together with all resources used by them (or
	at least leave the resources ready for garbage-collection). This function
	does just that.

	Note that this is ALWAYS COMPLETELY SAFE to call, even if you still have
	live prepared statements you intend to use again. This is safe because
	mysql-native will automatically register or re-register prepared statements
	as-needed.

	Notes:

	In actuality, the prepared statements might not be immediately released
	(although `isRegistered` will still report `false` for them).

	This is because there could be a `mysql.result.ResultRange` with results
	still pending for retrieval, and the protocol doesn't allow sending commands
